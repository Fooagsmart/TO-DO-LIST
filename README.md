# TO-DO-LIST
What is a todo list?
A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. 
That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do listâ€”but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful.
Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done.

WHY KEEP A TO DO FILE?
For a project, there any many sources of information like Documentation, Issue forum, Wiki pages, etc. It is hard to find out about the current progress.

Keeping a TODO.md file makes it easier for anyone who wants to know about the project's plans and work that needs to be done.
